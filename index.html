            <h3>Where ?</h3>
            <p>
              Dubai is a city and emirate on the Persian Gulf coast in the
              United Arab Emirates, which is famous for its luxury shopping,
              cutting-edge architecture, restaurants and nightlife. The
              silhouette of the city is formed by countless skyscrapers,
              including the Burj Khalifa, which is 830 meters high. At its base
              is the musical fountain "Dubai", illuminated by spotlights. On a
              man-made island off the coast, Atlantis The Palm Resort features a
              water park and a marine animal park.

            <h3>Why ?</h3>
            <p>
              Many of the residents of Dubai don't even have to work to support
              their luxury lifestyles. Supported by oil profits, they are free
              to shop and play all day! In 2003, Condé Nast Traveler's readers'
              poll voted Dubai the world's safest locale. People who live there
              claim there is virtually no crime. Thinking pristine sandy
              beaches, blue water and palm trees? Want to indulge yourself in
              gourmet food and shopping? Love clear skies and little rain? Then
              Dubai is your place. Let's go on a virtual tour first. After that,
              you may want to consider traveling to this rich, opulent
              destination for your next vacation. Time to start searching the
              Internet for cheap flights to Dubai!

            <h3>When ?</h3>
            <p>
              November to February is considered to be the best time to visit
              this emirate, as temperatures are pleasant and there’s a buzz in
              the air with a range of events and activities from the Dubai
              Shopping and Food Festivals to the Dubai World Cup. Average
              temperatures in November sit at around 25°C, with highs of 30°C
              and lows of a comfortable 19°C. This means November is an
              excellent choice for those looking to soak up some sunshine – with
              reliable suncream to hand, of course.
